# Planned: An open-source, cross-platform personal productivity tool
Planned is an open-source, cross-platform application to help you increase your productivity by providing a lot of features so that can help you work efficiently. Here are some of the goals of the project

* Completely free and open-source 
* cross-platform
* Note taking
* Time tracker
* Daily schedule planner
* Task planner
* Event planner
* Pomodoro
* Easy backup and restore either local or with Google Drive, Dropbox or Nextcloud

# We are nowhere near
Although none of the above goals have been reached so far, except for the first one. Planned so far
does not have any of the features nicely implemented, nor it is completely cross-platform.

# Technolagies
Planned is written in the Rust language and Gtk-rs. The interface is designed using the Glade UI designer. Currently developemnt takes place only on Linux platforms. Rust is choosen because of its strict memory safety features

# The difficult parts
We are facing some difficulties while writing Planned such as lack of good Gtk-rs docs as well some of the limitations of the Rust language, but the limitations are great for memory safety. Also writing code that is easy for us as well as the community to understand is difficult

# The hopes are high
But we are trying to slowly implement all of the goals, while still keeping good code helps and we see a bright future for Planned. Thanks to everyone for helping
